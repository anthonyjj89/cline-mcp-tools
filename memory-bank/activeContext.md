# Claude Task Reader MCP Server - Active Context

## Current State

As of March 23, 2025, we have successfully implemented the Claude Task Reader MCP Server with the following components:

- ✅ Core MCP server implementation
- ✅ Task service for listing and retrieving task metadata
- ✅ Conversation service for accessing and filtering conversation history
- ✅ Memory-efficient JSON processing utilities
- ✅ Cross-platform file path resolution

We've removed all web-related components to focus exclusively on the MCP functionality as requested.

## Recent Changes

1. **Removed Web Components**:
   - Deleted the entire `src/web` directory
   - Removed web-related dependencies (express, ejs) from package.json
   - Simplified the app.ts file to only start the MCP server
   - Cleaned up related imports and references

2. **Focused on MCP Implementation**:
   - Verified the MCP server builds and runs correctly
   - Ensured all MCP capabilities remain intact
   - Added comprehensive documentation in memory-bank files

## Current Working State

- The server can be built with `npm run build`
- The server can be run with `npm start`
- The server connects to Claude Desktop via MCP
- The server accesses VS Code extension conversation files efficiently
- All MCP capabilities are properly implemented and exposed

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:
   - Test with actual VS Code extension conversation files
   - Verify memory efficiency with large (2-3MB+) files
   - Test cross-platform compatibility

2. **Integration with Claude Desktop**:
   - Add the server to cline_mcp_settings.json
   - Test invocation from Claude Desktop
   - Verify data flow and response formatting

3. **Potential Improvements**:
   - Add more advanced filtering options
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Further optimize performance for very large files

## Immediate Tasks

- [ ] Test the server with real VS Code extension conversation files
- [ ] Add the server to Claude Desktop's MCP configuration
- [ ] Create a simple test script to verify memory efficiency
