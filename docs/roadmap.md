## Version 1.0.0 (Planned)

### Stability and Reliability
- Comprehensive test coverage for all features
- Performance benchmarks and optimizations
- Security audits and improvements
- Documentation updates and refinements

### Enterprise Features
- Multi-user support
- Team collaboration features
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging and compliance features

## Current Issues (v0.5.4)

Based on comprehensive testing and recent development, we've identified the following issues that need to be addressed in future versions:

### MCP Protocol Compatibility Issues
- Some MCP tools encounter "Method not found" errors due to inconsistencies in method naming conventions
- The `recover_crashed_chat` tool works correctly when called directly but has issues when called through the MCP protocol
- Workaround: Use the direct call approach with `test-crash-recovery-direct-call.js` for reliable crash recovery

### Data Volume and Filtering
- The `find_code_discussions` tool returns too much data, making it difficult to use effectively
- Need to add better filtering options or pagination for large result sets
- Improve result formatting for better readability

### Naming Convention Inconsistencies
- Some references to "Claude Task Reader" still exist in the codebase
- Need to update all references to use "Cline Chat Reader" for consistency

### Integration Challenges
- Better integration needed between Active Conversations and Crash Recovery features
- Improve error handling when active conversations are not available
- Enhance compatibility between standard Cline and Cline Ultra extensions

## Recent Improvements (v0.5.0 - v0.5.4)

### Active Conversations (v0.5.0)
- Added the ability to mark conversations as "Active A" or "Active B"
- Implemented the `get_active_task` MCP tool
- Updated all conversation-related tools to support active conversations
- Added special placeholder values `ACTIVE_A` and `ACTIVE_B`

### External Advice Enhancements (v0.5.1)
- Implemented folder-based approach for dismissed notifications
- Added `Dismissed` subdirectory within each task's external-advice directory
- Added support for moving notifications between directories

### Crash Recovery (v0.5.2 - v0.5.4)
- Enhanced crash recovery with user-focused output format
- Added main topic and subtopics detection
- Implemented recent conversation flow extraction
- Added current status detection at the time of crash
- Added active files identification based on conversation context
- Implemented Crash Reports Directory for storing recovered conversations
- Added automatic creation of crash reports directories in Cline Ultra
- Simplified the crash recovery workflow

### Extension Type Identification (v0.5.0)
- Added explicit `extensionType` field in TaskMetadata interface
- Improved task identification for both Cline Ultra and Cline Regular extensions
- Fixed issue where Claude Desktop was misidentifying tasks based on content analysis

## Potential Improvements

- Implement a more robust MCP server initialization process

### Enhanced Visualization and User Experience
- Format tool results in a more readable way (tables, charts, etc.)
- Add syntax highlighting for code snippets
- Create visual summaries of conversation analysis
- Implement interactive visualizations for complex data

### Expanded Functionality
