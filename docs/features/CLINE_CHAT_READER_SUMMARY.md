# Cline Chat Reader MCP Server

## Summary of Changes

We've successfully completed the following tasks:

1. **Fixed the "latest chat" detection issue**:
   - Modified the `listTasks` function to sort tasks based on the modification time of the files inside the directories
   - Added `lastActivityTimestamp` property to task objects
   - Updated the `getTask` function to include the `lastActivityTimestamp` in the returned object
   - Modified the `searchConversations` function to use the `listTasks` function to get tasks sorted by `lastActivityTimestamp`
   - Added notes to all MCP server tool handlers to explain that tasks are sorted by `lastActivityTimestamp`

2. **Set up Git repository**:
   - Initialized a git repository
   - Created a .gitignore file
   - Added all files to the repository
   - Made an initial commit
   - Tagged the commit as v0.1.0

3. **Renamed the project**:
   - Renamed from "Claude Task Reader" to "Cline Chat Reader"
   - Renamed all instances of "task" to "chat" in documentation
   - Updated package.json with the new name and version
   - Created a new branch for the renaming changes
   - Committed the changes
   - Tagged the commit as v0.1.1
   - Merged the branch back to main

## Next Steps

To complete the renaming process, the following steps are still needed:

1. **Rename source files**:
   - Rename `task-service.js` to `chat-service.js`
   - Rename `task.js` to `chat.js`

2. **Update code**:
   - Replace all instances of "task" with "chat" in the code
   - Update function names (e.g., `listTasks` → `listChats`)
   - Update variable names (e.g., `taskId` → `chatId`)
   - Update file paths and imports

3. **Rename the project directory**:
   - Rename from "Claude-Task-Reader" to "Cline-Chat-Reader"

4. **Update Claude Desktop configuration**:
   - Update the configuration to use the new name and path

## Testing

After completing the renaming process, the following tests should be run:

1. **Run the automated test suite**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ant/Cline-Chat-Reader
   ./tests/test-tools.js
   ```

2. **Test the integration with Claude Desktop**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ant/Cline-Chat-Reader
   ./tests/test-claude-integration.js
   ```

3. **Test the latest chat detection feature**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ant/claude-dev-mcp
